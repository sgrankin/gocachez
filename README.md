# gocachez

`gocachez` is a [`GOCACHEPROG`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go/internal/cacheprog)
helper for the Go build cache. It stores cache artifacts as zstd-compressed
files, materializes uncompressed files for the Go command on demand, and evicts
old compressed entries automatically.

This project was inspired by the discussion on
[`golang/go#76337`](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/76337).

## Installation

Requires Go 1.25 or newer.

```console
$ go install github.com/jakebailey/gocachez@latest
$ go env -w GOCACHEPROG=gocachez
```

Undo:

```console
$ go env -u GOCACHEPROG
```

## Commands

Show help:

```console
$ gocachez -h
```

Run as a `GOCACHEPROG` helper:

```console
$ gocachez
```

Remove inactive cache state:

```console
$ gocachez clean
```

`clean` removes blobs, live files, and catalog state that no active `gocachez`
process is using. State for active live runs is preserved.

Show cache state:

```console
$ gocachez status
```

`status` reports the current cache configuration and state.

## How it works

`gocachez` implements the Go command's external cache protocol over stdin and
stdout. The Go command sends `put` requests when it wants to store an artifact
and `get` requests when it wants to retrieve one.

On `put`, `gocachez`:

1. streams the artifact body into a zstd encoder,
2. writes the compressed bytes into `blobs/`,
3. writes the uncompressed body into the current run's `live/` directory, and
4. returns that live file path to the Go command as `DiskPath`.

The compressed blob is the durable cache entry. The live file is only the
temporary uncompressed file the Go command needs in order to read the artifact
from disk.

On `get`, `gocachez` looks up the action ID in SQLite. On a hit, it opens the
compressed blob, decompresses it into the current run's `live/` directory, and
returns the materialized path as `DiskPath`.

Live files are removed when the `GOCACHEPROG` process closes. If `gocachez`
exits abnormally, a later run can safely clean up abandoned live files: each run
holds an OS file lock, and another process only reclaims a run directory after
it can acquire that lock.

Some live files can escape the Go command process through `go list` output. For
example, `go list -export` reports an `Export` path that tools such as
`go/packages` and `golangci-lint` may open after the Go command has closed its
`GOCACHEPROG` helper. `go list -compiled` can also report generated cgo source
paths in `CompiledGoFiles`, and `go list -test` can report a generated
`_testmain.go` path in the synthetic test main package's `GoFiles`.

To support those tools without keeping large uncompressed archives around,
`gocachez` treats these escaped files specially on close. Package archives are
replaced with small archives containing only their `__.PKGDEF` export data, and
generated Go source files that can appear in list output are retained as-is.
These retained files are stored under `retained/`, keyed by output ID, and are
cleaned up once no catalog entry references that output.

## Configuration

By default, `gocachez` reads its config from:

```text
os.UserConfigDir()/gocachez/config.json
```

and stores cache data in:

```text
os.UserCacheDir()/gocachez
```

See [`os.UserConfigDir`](https://pkg.go.dev/os#UserConfigDir) and
[`os.UserCacheDir`](https://pkg.go.dev/os#UserCacheDir) for the
platform-specific base directories.

Example config:

```json
{
    "cacheDir": "/path/to/gocachez",
    "maxSize": "20GiB",
    "maxAge": "5d",
    "verbose": false
}
```

Config can also be selected explicitly:

```console
$ go env -w GOCACHEPROG="gocachez -config /path/to/config.json"
```

Supported options:

**Cache directory**

- Config: `cacheDir`
- Environment: `GOCACHEZ_DIR`
- Flag: `-dir`
- Default: `os.UserCacheDir()/gocachez`

**Maximum compressed cache size**

- Config: `maxSize`
- Environment: `GOCACHEZ_MAX_SIZE`
- Flag: `-max-size`
- Default: `20GiB`; `0` disables size-based pruning.

**Maximum age of unused entries**

- Config: `maxAge`
- Environment: `GOCACHEZ_MAX_AGE`
- Flag: `-max-age`
- Default: `5d`, matching `cmd/go`'s `GOCACHE`; `0` disables age-based pruning.
  Accepts a duration such as `5d`, `36h`, or `90m`.

Age-based pruning is independent of `maxSize`: entries and retained files that
have not been used within `maxAge` are trimmed even while the cache is under its
size limit.

Both limits are enforced by a maintenance scan that runs at most once an hour,
and only when no build is using the cache — the scan is proportional to the size
of the cache, and the `go` command waits for `gocachez` to exit, so running it on
every build would add that cost to every build. `maxSize` is therefore a target
rather than a hard cap: the cache can exceed it between scans. A single build
that writes a large fraction of `maxSize` scans on its way out instead of waiting
for the next interval, but many smaller builds can still drift past the limit
until the next scan brings the cache back under it.

**Verbose maintenance logs**

- Config: `verbose`
- Environment: `GOCACHEZ_VERBOSE`
- Flag: `-v`
- Default: `false`

**Config file path**

- Environment: `GOCACHEZ_CONFIG`
- Flag: `-config`
- Default: `os.UserConfigDir()/gocachez/config.json`
- Missing file is an error when explicitly set.
